            <h2>Understanding the VGC Format</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the world of <strong>Competitive Pokémon</strong>! Whether you're new to battling or just looking to improve, this guide will help you get started in the <strong>VGC (Video Game Championships)</strong> format. VGC is a doubles format where you use two Pokémon at a time in battle. Let’s break it down step by step.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Battle Format:</strong> VGC battles are played in <strong>doubles</strong>, meaning you send out two Pokémon at a time.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Building:</strong> You create a team of <strong>six Pokémon</strong> but can only bring <strong>four</strong> to each battle.</li>
                <li><strong>Leveling:</strong> All Pokémon in VGC tournaments are set to <strong>level 50</strong> (unless otherwise stated).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Rules You Need to Know</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Banned Pokémon:</strong> Some Pokémon are not allowed in official tournaments, like legendaries or certain mythical Pokémon.</li>
                <li><strong>Item Limits:</strong> You can only have <strong>one of each item</strong> on your team, so no duplicates.</li>
                <li><strong>Moves and Abilities:</strong> Check to make sure your moves and abilities are legal for the current tournament rules.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Building Your Team</h2>
            <p>When creating a team, balance is key! Here are some pointers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type Coverage:</strong> Make sure your team has a variety of types to cover all possible threats. For example, don’t rely too much on Fire-type Pokémon—cover it with Water or Rock-types.</li>
                <li><strong>Roles for Pokémon:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leads:</strong> These are your first Pokémon, typically fast and aggressive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Pokémon that help the team with moves like healing, setting up hazards, or controlling speed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Offensive Power:</strong> Pokémon that deal heavy damage to your opponent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Understanding Moves and Abilities</h2>
            <p>A big part of competitive play is knowing how to use moves and abilities effectively:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus):</strong> Moves that match your Pokémon’s type deal more damage. For example, a Fire-type Pokémon using a Fire-type move will hit harder.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed Control:</strong> Speed is crucial. Moves like <strong>Tailwind</strong> or <strong>Icy Wind</strong> can give you the edge in controlling the pace of the battle.</li>
                <li><strong>Status Moves:</strong> Moves like <strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong> (to burn) or <strong>Thunder Wave</strong> (to paralyze) are great for disrupting your opponent’s Pokémon.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Strategies to Win</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Know Your Type Matchups:</strong> Certain types are stronger than others. For example, Water beats Fire, and Electric beats Water. Build your team to exploit these matchups.</li>
                <li><strong>Switching and Positioning:</strong> Learn when to swap Pokémon to preserve your team or take advantage of your opponent’s weaknesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Endgame:</strong> As the battle progresses, you’ll want to make sure your strongest Pokémon are still in play for the final blow.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pokémon Showdown:</strong> This online battle simulator is a great place to practice your team and learn strategies without needing a game console.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch Tournaments:</strong> Watch top players compete in events to see how advanced strategies are executed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Join Tournaments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Online Competitions:</strong> Start by participating in <strong>online tournaments</strong> or local events to gain experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Always Check the Rules:</strong> Each tournament may have different rules, so make sure to read them before entering.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Stay Updated</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meta Shifts:</strong> The competitive scene changes with every new game release, and the <strong>meta</strong> (the most effective strategies and Pokémon) evolves.</li>
                <li><strong>Ban Lists:</strong> Keep an eye on the banned Pokémon list. New Pokémon or strategies might get banned to keep the game balanced.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Terms to Know</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>STAB:</strong> Increased damage when a Pokémon uses a move of the same type.</li>
                <li><strong>EVs:</strong> Effort Values, which determine how strong your Pokémon’s stats are.</li>
                <li><strong>IVs:</strong> Individual Values, hidden stats that affect a Pokémon’s potential in each stat.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
